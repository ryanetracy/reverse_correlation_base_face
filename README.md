# reverse_correlation_base_face

This repository contains base faces for use in Reverse correlation studies.

Previous studies have used composite faces, though these are often without
standardization. The faces contained here consist of blends of images taken
from the Chicago Face Database (Ma et al., 2015). With these, I aim to provide
an open-source set of tools for use by researchers interested in exploring
mental representations of the face-trait space, racial ambiguity, and other
aspects of group membership.

Over time, normalization data will be included for all images, so that
researchers can account for baseline perceptions of the base image used in
their work.

The current images consist of 90 identities (per category) from the CFD. The
biracial faces consist of 90 Black and 90 White individuals, averaged together
using WebMorpher software.
